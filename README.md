# What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  During this project I was able to gain a considerable amount of experience working with OpenGL, improve my texture creation pipeline, and gain additional knowledge of C++.
# What design process did you follow for your project work?
 Using the reference images to guide the creation of this scene, while the final scene is not an exact recreation of the reference material, it is a close approximation.
# How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
During this course I gained additional experience in the texture creation pipeline, the use of reference images is not new in my pipeline, but the chance to do so in a learning environment
was crucial to the furthering of my craft.
# How do I approach developing programs?
 I use an iterative approach, adding elements piecemeal, taking time to debug and refine each section of the code as I go. This helps to ensure that my projects are as stable and performant as possible.
 However, I am sure that with time I will learn even more techniques and strategies using C++ for the creation of even more efficient programs.
# What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
This project gave me an opportunity to explore the use of an expanded toolkit, primarily through the use of Krita and GIMP in the creation of new textures for the scene. 
This project also gave me an early taste of OpenGL, which I use again, not just professionally but also in at least two more of my upcoming courses IT312 and GAM415.
# How did iteration factor into your development?
 Each new stage of development was throughly tested through an iterative development process. However, in future I will also be using Codecks.io in documentation generation for new projects, especially as they
 relate to my CS and GPD degrees.
# How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
 This project continued to refine my development skills, building on habits I first developed when I began coding in Java in 2007. Ensuring that I follow a consistent iterative development process, testing
 new additions to the code prior to each commit to the (original) repo. Further, this project gave me exposure to the age old problem of, "It worked on my machine", when I realized that one of my submissions did
 not include of the necessary dependancies for successful launch of the .exe included in that version of the project.
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
 My goals and computer science go hand in hand, my dream career being a Game Programmer / Graphics Programmer. While the industry is in a rough spot now, with less than %2 of open rolls being for entry level according to
 some statistics, the fact remains that a CS degree is one of the most effective ways of getting into the industry.
# How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational/professional pathway?
 While OpenGL has largely fallen out of favor in lieu of its successor, Vulcan, the fact remains that OpenGL is an excellent introduction into the world of 3D graphics, without courses like this one I would have to rely
 solely on self taught skills and methodologies. Further, the expansion of my understanding of C++ is paramount, to both my educational and professional pathways, as it remains one of the most popular languages for game development, and indeed most of my courses use either Java, C++, or UE5 Blueprints.
